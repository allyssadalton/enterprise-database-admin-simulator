# Enterprise Database Admin Simulator (Airline Baggage Management)

## Project Overview
The Enterprise Database Admin Simulator is a simulation system designed to mimic the real-world operations of an airline's baggage management. It aims to model both passenger and employee interactions with checked and carry-on luggage, flight information, and unclaimed baggage management. This system provides a practical experience in database administration and enterprise data handling.

## Objectives
- Simulate the check-in, security, and boarding processes of airline baggage.
- Track baggage status throughout its journey.
- Manage employee and passenger interactions with the system.
- Provide notifications to passengers regarding their baggage.
- Include database structures suitable for real-world airline operations.
- Demonstrate use of advanced data structures (queues, stacks, linked lists) in backend logic.

## Key Features
- **Employee Interface:** Login system, manage baggage status, move bags between locations, contact passengers, view flight manifests.
- **Passenger Interface:** Check baggage status, track flight details, view unclaimed baggage, report missing luggage.
- **Baggage Tracking:** Real-time updates on bag location and status (e.g., Checked In, In Transit, At Carousel, Unclaimed).
- **Flight Management:** Track flights, capacity, departure/arrival times, and assigned baggage.
- **Notifications:** Email/text alerts for baggage events.

## Technologies
- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- Backend: C++/Python
- Frontend: Optional CLI or Web Interface
- Data Structures: Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists
- Optional: Docker for deployment
